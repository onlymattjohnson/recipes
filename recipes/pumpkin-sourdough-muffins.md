# Pumpkin Sourdough Muffins

Source: I can't believe I'm saying this, but I got this from an [AI chatbot](https://claude.ai)

## Ingredients:

- 175g sourdough discard (about 3/4 cup)
- 3/4 cup (180ml) pure maple syrup
- 1/3 cup (80ml) vegetable oil
- 2 flax eggs (2 tbsp ground flaxseed + 6 tbsp water)
- 1 cup (240g) canned pumpkin puree
- 3/4 cup (95g) all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup (60g) whole wheat flour
- 1/2 cup (45g) oat flour (or finely ground rolled oats)
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
- 1/3 cup (80ml) non-dairy milk (such as almond or oat milk)
- 1/2 cup (60g) chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners or grease well.

2. Prepare the flax eggs by mixing 2 tbsp ground flaxseed with 6 tbsp water. Let sit for 5 minutes to thicken.

3. In a large bowl, whisk together the sourdough discard, maple syrup, oil, prepared flax eggs, pumpkin puree, and non-dairy milk until well combined.

4. In a separate bowl, mix the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, oat flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and pumpkin pie spice.

5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. If the batter seems too thick, add a little more non-dairy milk, 1 tablespoon at a time.

6. If using, fold in the chopped nuts.

7. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full.

8. Bake for 23-27 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the muffins reaches 200°F to 205°F (93°C to 96°C). If you don't have a thermometer, the muffins should be golden brown on top and spring back when lightly pressed.

9. Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.


## Notes:

When I cooked it for 23 minutes, they were done.
