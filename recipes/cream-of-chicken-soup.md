## 🍳 Instructions

1. **Prep "Chicken":**  
   Rehydrate soy curls in hot broth or water for 10 minutes, then drain and chop. If using seitan, dice into bite-sized chunks.

2. **Sauté Aromatics & Potatoes:**  
   In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion, celery, carrot (if using), and potatoes. Sauté for 5–7 minutes, until onions are soft.

3. **Season & Simmer:**  
   Add garlic, thyme, sage, turmeric, and onion powder. Stir for 1 minute.  
   Add broth, soy curls/seitan, corn, and peas. Simmer for 12–15 minutes, or until potatoes are tender.

4. **Blend Cream Base:**  
   In a blender, combine cashews, soy milk, flour, and bouillon. Blend until completely smooth.

5. **Thicken Soup:**  
   Slowly stir cream base into the pot. Simmer for another 5–10 minutes, stirring often, until thick and creamy.

6. **Finish with Flavor:**  
   Turn off heat. Stir in nutritional yeast, lactic acid or lemon juice, salt, pepper, and optional MSG. Adjust seasoning to taste.

7. **Serve:**  
   Garnish with parsley, black pepper, or red chili flakes if desired. Serve hot with crusty bread or over rice for a full meal.
