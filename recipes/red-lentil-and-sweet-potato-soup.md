# Instant Pot Creamy Curried Red Lentil & Sweet Potato Soup

A velvety, nutrient-rich soup featuring red lentils and sweet potatoes with a warming curry flavor. The cashew cream adds luxurious texture without coconut milk's saturated fat. This version is optimized for the Instant Pot for convenient, hands-off cooking.

### For the Soup:
- 1 cup red lentils, rinsed and drained
- 2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed (about 3 cups)
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 carrots, chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated
- 2 tsp curry powder
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp ground coriander
- 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
- Pinch of cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)
- 3 1/2 cups vegetable broth
- 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
- Salt and pepper to taste

### For the Cashew Cream:
- 1 cup raw cashews, soaked for at least 30 minutes in hot water
- 3/4 cup water
- Pinch of salt
- 1/2 tsp lemon juice

### Optional Toppings:
- Roasted pumpkin seeds
- Fresh cilantro or parsley
- Drizzle of olive oil
- Additional cashew cream
- Sprinkle of smoked paprika

## Instructions

### Prepare the Cashew Cream:
1. Drain and rinse the soaked cashews.
2. Add cashews, water, salt, and lemon juice to your Vitamix.
3. Blend on high for 1-2 minutes until completely smooth and creamy.
4. Set aside 1 cup for the soup and refrigerate any remaining cream for other uses.

### Make the Soup (Instant Pot Method):
1. Set Instant Pot to Sauté mode. Add olive oil, onion, and carrots. Sauté for 3-4 minutes until softened.
2. Add garlic and ginger, sauté for 1 minute until fragrant.
3. Add curry powder, cumin, coriander, and cinnamon. Toast the spices for 30 seconds, stirring constantly.
4. Add sweet potatoes, lentils, and vegetable broth. Stir to combine and ensure nothing is stuck to the bottom.
5. Close the lid, set valve to sealing position. Cook on Manual/Pressure Cook (high pressure) for 10 minutes.
6. Once cooking is complete, allow a natural pressure release for 10 minutes, then carefully perform a quick release for any remaining pressure.
7. Transfer the soup to your Vitamix in batches and blend until completely smooth. (Alternatively, you can use an immersion blender directly in the pot if you have one).
8. Return the blended soup to the Instant Pot and stir in 3/4 cup of the prepared cashew cream and lemon juice.
9. Set to Sauté mode on low and heat gently for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
10. Taste and adjust seasonings with salt and pepper.

### Serve:
Ladle into bowls and garnish with a swirl of the remaining cashew cream, a sprinkle of fresh herbs, pumpkin seeds, and a light drizzle of olive oil if desired.
